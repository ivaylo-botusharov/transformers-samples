Removed from python-3.11.3-installer-pkg.sh:

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

echo 'alias python=/usr/local/bin/python3.11' >> ~/.zshrc

source ~/.zshrc

------

~/.zshrc:
(/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.zshrc):

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

export PATH="/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin:$PATH"

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"

------

~/.bash_profile
(/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.bash_profile):

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"

export PATH="/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin:$PATH"


echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

------

Poetry:

`export PATH="/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin:$PATH"`

`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable.

Add `export PATH="/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.

Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `/Users/ivaylo.botusharov/.local/bin/poetry`.

You can test that everything is set up by executing:

`poetry --version`

Type sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/python* and press Enter.
Type hash -r and press Enter.
This should remove all Python versions from your computer
