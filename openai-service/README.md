*Option B:* Open [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) - (sidebar) Playground section - Chat. In the 'Configuration' column on the page right-hand side - Deployment tab - Deployment* dropdown - select your GPT-4 Deployment name.  

In 'Chat session' column - click on 'View code'. A 'Sample Code' modal will open - at it's bottom you should see 'Endpoint' and 'Key' fields.  

Endponint - click on 'Copy to clipboard' button on the right side of the value. Paste the value in a text file temporarily.  
Key - click on 'Copy to clipboard' button on the right side of the value. Paste the value in a text file temporarily.  

### 6. Replace endpoint, key and deploymentOrModelName value placeholders in the app

Open ```ConsoleChat/Program.cs``` and replace the variable values:  

```CSharp
string endpoint = "your-azure-openai-service-endpoint-url-here";
string key = "your-azure-openai-service-key-here";

// Enter the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model.
string deploymentOrModelName = "your-deployment-name-here";
```

*Note:* This is just a temporary solution (DO NOT push these changes in public GitHub repository).

```CSharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using static System.Environment;

string endpoint = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
string key = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY");

OpenAIClient client = new(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

var chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?"),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Do other Azure Cognitive Services support this too?"),
    },
    MaxTokens = 100
};

Response<StreamingChatCompletions> response = await client.GetChatCompletionsStreamingAsync(
    deploymentOrModelName: "gpt-35-turbo",
    chatCompletionsOptions);
using StreamingChatCompletions streamingChatCompletions = response.Value;

await foreach (StreamingChatChoice choice in streamingChatCompletions.GetChoicesStreaming())
{
    await foreach (ChatMessage message in choice.GetMessageStreaming())
    {
        Console.Write(message.Content);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

, but with added option to have a conversation between a user and a bot. Also added the option to remember the context from previous questions and their answers.
